/**
 * Exercise (Chapter 4: GUIs with Swing) — matching a layout.
 *
 * Press ▶ on {@code main} to open the window. Right now every component is
 * crammed into a single row. Rearrange the components in {@link #buildForm()} —
 * using nested panels and layout managers (see 4.2) — so the window matches the
 * target screenshot in the notes: the two labelled text fields stacked
 * vertically, with the "Submit" and "Cancel" buttons centred in a row beneath
 * them.
 *
 * There is no automated test for this exercise: you check it by running it and
 * comparing with the picture. See "4.5 Testing UI code" for why UI layout is
 * usually verified by eye rather than by a test.
 *
 * Relevant reading: 4.1 Creating and showing a window, 4.2 Java Swing visual
 * components.
